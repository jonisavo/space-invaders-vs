# Space Invaders VS

![screenshot](/screenshot.png)

This is a university assignment I created in a month: a working multiplayer game made with Unity.
It is a multiplayer Space Invaders clone, where two players race to beat the last round.

The project has two big dependencies: Photon Unity Networking 2 and TextMeshPro.

## Set up

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Unity 2019.4.17+
3. Import PUN 2 and run the PUN Wizard
4. Import TextMeshPro and run the "Import TMP Essential Resources" wizard
5. Restart Unity
6. You should be good to go!

## Known issues

The game was not made with multiple resolutions in mind, mostly because I have very little
knowledge of Unity and did not have the time to design a responsive UI. Playing the game
with a screen resolution higher than 1080p may result in strange visuals.
