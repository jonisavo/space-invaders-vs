# Space Invaders VS

This is a *work-in-progress* university assignment: a working game made with Unity.
It is a multiplayer Space Invaders clone, where two players race to beat the last round.

The project has two big dependencies: PUN 2 and TextMeshPro.

## To do

1. Actual functioning game loop
2. Proper movement for invaders (it is currently broken)
3. Cover for players
4. UFOs
5. Music & sound
6. Nicer menus
7. Powerups?
8. Other goodies?

## Set up

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Unity 2019.4.17f1 or newer
3. Import PUN 2 and run the PUN Wizard
4. Import TextMeshPro and run the "Import TMP Essential Resources" wizard
5. You should be good to go!
