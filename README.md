# Space Invaders VS

![screenshot](./screenshot.png)

This project started out as a university assignment: a working multiplayer game made with Unity.
It is a multiplayer Space Invaders clone, where two players race to beat the last round.

The project has two big dependencies: Photon Unity Networking 2 and TextMeshPro.
